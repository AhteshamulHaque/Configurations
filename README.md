Note: Do not copy lvim/ to ~/.config/
Instead
  -> create softlink for lvim/colors/ in ~/.config/lvim/colors
  -> create softlink for lvim/config.lua as ~/.config/lvim/config.lua
  -> create softlink for lvim/lua/ as ~/.config/lvim/lua

This will link the editing of configuration at both the positions
Only make changes int this repository so that it gets reflected in
~/.config/lvim
